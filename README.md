# 🎊 BigOCcasion

> Because learning DSA in C++ is not just an event... it's a **BigOCcasion**.

Welcome to the ultimate deep dive into **Data Structures and Algorithms** using the C++ programming language!  
This is where we manually `malloc()` our future, `free()` our fears, and try not to `segfault()` our dreams.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

- 📦 Arrays, Strings, and Pointers
- 🧱 Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists
- 🌳 Trees that branch into forests (BST, AVL, etc.)
- 🕸️ Graphs so tangled, even DFS gets lost
- ⚔️ Sorting & Searching that fight for time complexity
- 🧮 Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and other ancient runes
- 🧨 Bonus: Debugging nightmares, undefined behavior, and sudden existential dread

## 🚀 Why C?

Because real programmers use semicolons and cry over memory leaks.

## 🛠 Compilation

```bash
gcc your_file.c -o your_program
./your_program
