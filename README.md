> Because learning DSA in C++ is not just an event... it's a **BigOCcasion**.

Welcome to the ultimate deep dive into **Data Structures and Algorithms** using the C++ programming language!
This is where we `new` up our future, `delete` our fears, and try not to `segfault` our dreams.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

- 📦 Arrays, Strings, `std::vector`, and Pointers
- 🧱 Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists
- 🌳 Trees that branch into forests (BST, AVL, etc.)
- 🕸️ Graphs so tangled, even DFS gets lost
- ⚔️ Sorting & Searching that fight for time complexity
- 🧮 Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and other ancient runes
- 💥 Bonus: Debugging nightmares, template metaprogramming, and RAII

## 🚀 Why C++?

Because we want performance, control, and high-level abstractions without giving up the right to manage our own memory.

## 🛠 Compilation

To compile a single file:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o your_program your_file.cpp
./your_program
```

To compile and run all projects at once, use the provided script:

```bash
./build_and_run.sh
```
