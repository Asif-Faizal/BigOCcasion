# 1. Hello World in C

This project is a simple "Hello, World!" program written in the C programming language.

## Code Explanation

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf`.
* `int main()`: This is the main function where program execution begins.
* `printf("Hello, World!\\n");`: This line uses the `printf` function to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by a newline character `\n`.
* `return 0;`: This line indicates that the program has executed successfully.
